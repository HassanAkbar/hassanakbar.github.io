## ECMA6 ? Why ?

ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced many changes to JavaScript. We will look into some of the most common features and syntax additions comparing them in ES6. 

We will start with the difference in variable declaration in ES6.


## Variable Declaration (var vs let vs const)

Let us start with the concepts of scoping. After we get an idea about scopting we will take it further to highlight the differences between let, var, and const in JavaScript.

### Scope
Scope defines where variables and functions are accessible inside of your program. In JavaScript, there are two kinds of scope - global scope, and function scope. What that means is if you create a variable with var, that variable is “scoped” to the function it was created in and is only accessible inside of that function or, any nested functions.



{% highlight javascript %}
function getDate () {
  var date = new Date();

  return date;
}

getDate();         // Sun Mar 10 2019 14:01:44 GMT+0500
console.log(date); // Uncaught ReferenceError: date is not defined
{% endhighlight %}


### Hoisting

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function). Lets take an example.

{% highlight javascript %}
function getX () {
  var x = 10;

  if(x)
  {
    var x = 4;
  }

  console.log(x);
}

getX();         // 4

{% endhighlight %}

The problem with the above function is that if I redecalared a variable it will override the same variable in its outer scope. This can be problematic because I would never want to change the value of my outer scope variable with an internal local scope variable.

### What can we do ?
We can use `let` to limit the value to an inner scope


{% highlight javascript %}
function getX () {
  var x = 10;

  if(x)
  {
    let x = 4;
  }

  console.log(x);
}
getX();         // 10

{% endhighlight %}

Bang! Problem solved!!

### Stop Tampering of Constant Values

Now lets assume a case where we want to make a value constant. 
Lets assume there is a function which returns the value of pie which is 3.14.

{% highlight javascript %}
function getPie () {
  var constant = 3.14;

  if(constant)
  {
    constant = 0;
  }

  console.log(constant);
}
getPie();         // 0

{% endhighlight %}

The above function returns 0 i.e. if we try to change the value of pie we can do it.

### What can we do ?
We can use `const` to stop assignment of pie.


{% highlight javascript %}
function getPie () {
  const constant = 3.14;

  if(constant)
  {
    constant = 0;
  }

  console.log(constant);
}
getPie();         // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

{% endhighlight %}


This table provides the summary of the above discussion.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Keyword</th>
      <th>Scope</th>
      <th>Hoisting</th>
      <th>Can Be Reassigned</th>

      <td>Function scope</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let"><code>let</code></a></td>
      <td>Block scope</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const"><code>const</code></a></td>
      <td>Block scope</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



To sum up the discussion, you should use `let` for local variables and `const` for constant values you wont have to handle the problems of scoping, hoisting, assignment and redeclaration.
